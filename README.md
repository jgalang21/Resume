# Resume

My name is Jeremy and I'm currently a Senior in Computer Engineering. 

I created this repository simply just to share a bit about me and what I've learned in coding throughout my time in school. 

# My Coding Experience

The languages I'm familiar with include: C, C++, Python, Java, React/Javascript, and Ruby.

If I were to rank how strong my coding skills are in a specific language, I would rank it as follows:

1. Java
2. C
3. React Native/JavaScript
4. Ruby
5. Python/C++

I'm also familiar with git and bash scripting.

The projects in my repository are mostly projects I have worked on over the summer or while in school. The rails-blog, exercism.io-solutions are projects I have found online and worked on. The Mars Rover Simulation and DrinkSafe App are the two big projects I have worked on. The Let's do Lunch program was given to me as a coding exercise by another company (The instructions are publicly available on Google). 

# Research IT 

I have also worked in Research IT, doing documentation for users on how to use command-line based software or perform certain tasks such as using Robocopy. A complete list of all the guides I have written are below:
