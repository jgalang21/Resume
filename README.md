# Resume

My name is Jeremy and I'm currently a Senior in Computer Engineering. 

I created this repository simply just to share a bit about me and what I've learned in coding throughout my time in school. 

# My Coding Experience

The languages I'm familiar with include: C, C++, Python, Java, and Ruby.

If I were to rank how strong my coding skills are in a specific language, I would rank it as follows:

1. Java
2. C
4. Ruby
3. Python/C++

The projects in my repository are mostly projects I have worked on over the summer or while in school. The rails-blog, exercism.io-solutions are projects I have found online and worked on. The Mars Rover Simulation and DrinkSafe App are the two big projects I have worked on. The Let's do Lunch program was given to me as a coding exercise by another company (The instructions are publicly available on Google). 


Some of the projects I have worked on for classes include: (These aren't in my repository, due to the Academic policy of the Computer Science department) 

* Solving an 8-puzzle using A* algorithm  - This project required us to solve the 8-puzzle, which is similar to a sliding puzzle that makes an image once solved, except with numbers. We were required to implement the A* algorithm  using two heuristics, and have the program output the solution path. 

* Creating a predetermined alphabet with sorting algorithms  - We were required to get a list of characters in a specific order and have that become our new "alphabet". With this, we implemented three sorting algorithms, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort. The user would import a list of words (in any order) that would eventually be sorted based off of our given alphabet. 

* Determining the efficiency of the Jarvis march and Graham's Scan algorithm - This assignment was simply learning how to implement Jarvis march and Graham's scan, two algorithms that select the outermost points and connects them on a graph. They're also commonly known as "package wrapping" techniques. This project also utilized stacks as our data structure. 

* Alarm clock - This was a simple alarm clock that could change between 12 hour and 24 hour format, and allowed a user to set a specific alarm time. I created this program when I was first learning object oriented programming. 

# Research IT 

I have also worked in Research IT, doing documentation for users on how to use command-line based software or perform certain tasks such as using Robocopy. A complete list of all the guides I have written are below:
