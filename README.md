# Resume

Hello! My name is Jeremy and I'm currently a Junior in Computer Engineering! I'd first like to say thank you for taking a look at my github! I know there isn't much to see, but I promise you it'll be worth your time. 


I created this repository simply just to share a bit about me and what I've learned in coding throughout my time in school. 

The languages I'm familiar with include: C, C++, Python, Java, and Ruby.

If I were to rank how strong my coding skills are in a specific language, I would rank it as follows:

1. Java
2. C
4. Ruby
3. Python/C++

The projects in my repository are mostly projects I have worked on over the summer. The rails-blog, exercism.io-solutions and Simple-Keylogger are projects I have found online and worked on. I was also in the process of learning how to use github as well, so I had to make some changes with some older repositories. 

Outside of this repositories, I have worked on many other projects for classes. The reason why they aren't on my github is because the computer science department has strict rules about uploading code to github for academic integrity reasons. However, if you are currently an employer and would like to see some of my other work, please contact me via the email I provided on my resume, not my github email. 

Some of the projects I have worked on for classes include: 

* Solving an 8-puzzle using A* algorithm  - This project required us to solve the 8-puzzle, which is similar to a sliding puzzle that makes an image once solved, except with numbers. We were required to implement the A* algorithm  using two heuristics, and have the program output the solution path. 

* Creating a predetermined alphabet with sorting algorithms  - We were required to get a list of characters in a specific order and have that become our new "alphabet". With this, we implemented three sorting algorithms, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort. The user would import a list of words (in any order) that would eventually be sorted based off of our given alphabet. 

* Determining the efficiency of the Jarvis march and Graham's Scan algorithm - This assignment was simply learning how to implement Jarvis march and Graham's scan, two algorithms that select the outermost points and connects them on a graph. They're also commonly known as "package wrapping" techniques. This project also utilized stacks as our data structure. 

* Alarm clock - This was a simple alarm clock that could change between 12 hour and 24 hour format, and allowed a user to set a specific alarm time. 


If you have any questions about my coding experience, or anything in general, please don't hesitate to contact me.
